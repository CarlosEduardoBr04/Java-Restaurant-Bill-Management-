# Java Restaurant Bill Management 🍽️

## Project Purpose 🚀

This Java project stands as a practical exercise, crafted to elevate and solidify Java programming skills. As an aspiring developer, each aspect of this project serves as a hands-on application of theoretical knowledge, providing a real-world scenario for honing your Java proficiency.

## `Comanda` Class Exploration 📇

### Key Features:

- **Attributes:**
  - `Mesa`, `ValorConsumo`, `ValorEstacionamento`, `ValorCouvert`, `ValorDescontoPromocional`, `ValorTotal`: Store crucial information related to restaurant bills.

- **Constructors:**
  - `public Comanda()`: Initiates a default `Comanda` object.
  - `public Comanda(int Mesa, double ValorConsumo, double ValorEstacionamento, double ValorCouvert, double ValorDescontoPromocional, double ValorTotal)`: Enables the creation of a `Comanda` with specific values.

- **Methods:**
  1. `LancarGastos()`: Records expenses like consumption, parking, cover charge, and promotional discount.
  2. `VerificarPromocao()`: Checks if the consumption exceeds 100, applying a 10% promotional discount if true.
  3. `ListarComanda()`: Displays detailed information about the bill.
  4. `TotalizarComanda()`: Calculates the total bill considering various factors.

## `Principal` Class Operation 🚀

### Main Method:

- `main(String[] args)`: Serves as the program's entry point. Creates an instance of the `Comanda` class (`controleMesa`) and orchestrates an interactive menu for users to seamlessly manage restaurant bills.
